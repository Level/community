## What is Level?

**Level is a community and a collection of Node.js modules for creating transparent databases. A solid set of primitives enable powerful databases to be built in userland. They can be embedded or networked, persistent or transient - in short, tailored to your needs.**

At the core of Level are simple key-value stores that follow the characteristics of [LevelDB](https://github.com/google/leveldb). LevelDB is a key-value store built by Google, used in Google Chrome and many other products. It supports arbitrary byte arrays as both keys and values, singular reads and writes, batched writes and bi-directional iterators. LevelDB sorts entries lexicographically by keys which, when combined with ranged iterators, makes for a very powerful query mechanism.

To bring those concepts to Node.js and other JavaScript runtimes, Level utilizes idiomatic Node.js interfaces like [streams](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html), [events](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html) and [buffers](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html). It offers a rich set of data types through [encodings](https://github.com/Level/encoding-down) and allows for extensions like [`subleveldown`](https://github.com/Level/subleveldown) to split a database into evented sections. Underlying stores can be easily swapped to target a wide range of runtime environments. The most common store is [`leveldown`](https://github.com/Level/leveldown) which is a pure C++ binding to LevelDB. [Many alternatives are available](https://github.com/Level/awesome/#stores) such as [`level-js`](https://github.com/Level/level-js) in the browser or [`memdown`](https://github.com/Level/memdown) for an in-memory store.

## FAQ

### Where do I start?

The [`level`](https://github.com/Level/level) module is the recommended way to get started. It offers a persistent database that works in Node.js and browsers. To store data in a different way you might like `level-mem` for example, which exports the same API as `level` but stores data in-memory. Visit [`level/awesome`](https://github.com/Level/awesome) to discover more modules.

### What is `abstract-level`?

_If you are new to Level, there is a quick answer: `abstract-level` is the new core of Level on top of which several databases are (or will be) implemented. Read on if you're already familiar with Level modules (before 2022) and have used `level`, `levelup`, `abstract-leveldown`, `encoding-down` or `deferred-leveldown`._

Back in 2012, [`levelup`](https://github.com/Level/levelup) offered a Node.js binding for Google's LevelDB. Authored by Rod Vagg, `levelup` exposed the features of LevelDB in a Node.js-friendly way. It had streams, binary support, encodings... all the goodies. Later on, the binding was moved to `leveldown`, so that other stores could be swapped in while retaining the friendly API of `levelup`.

This is when "up" vs "down" naming was born, where databases followed the formula of "level = levelup + leveldown". For example, `level-mem` was a convenience package that bundled `levelup` with `memdown`. The `abstract-leveldown` module offered a lower-level abstraction for the "down" part, to encapsulate common logic between "down" stores. Many such stores were written, replacing LevelDB with IndexedDB, RocksDB, in-memory red-black trees, relational databases and more.

Around 2017, further parts were extracted from `levelup` and moved to single-purpose modules. This effectively introduced the concept of "layers", where an implementation of `abstract-leveldown` wasn't necessarily a storage for `levelup` but could also wrap another `abstract-leveldown` implementation. For example, `levelup` encoding logic was extracted to [`encoding-down`](https://github.com/Level/encoding-down). This changed the database formula to "level = levelup + encoding-down + leveldown". Or in other words: "levelup + layer + layer".

This highly modular architecture led to clean code, where each module had a single responsibility. By this time, the overall API had settled and matured, some contributors moved on to other exciting things and the primary remaining effort was maintenance. This posed new challenges. We worked on test suites, added automated browser tests, code coverage and database manifests.

Yet, releases too often required canary testing in dependents. It was hard to predict the effect of a change. In addition, documentation became fragmented and some modules actually suffered from the high modularity, having to peel off layers to customize behavior. At the same time, we could see that typical usage of a Level database still involved encodings and the other goodies that the original `levelup` had.

Enter [`abstract-level`](https://github.com/Level/abstract-level). This module merges `levelup`, `encoding-down` and `abstract-leveldown` into a single codebase. There is more to say, but [`abstract-level`](https://github.com/Level/abstract-level) is a work in progress that hasn't yet proven itself, so we'll end here for now. Stay tuned!

### How do I upgrade to `abstract-level`?

_This section will explain how to replace old modules (that are based on `levelup` and `abstract-leveldown`) with new `abstract-level` based modules. At the time of writing, no `abstract-level` implementation has been published yet._

### Where can I get support?

If you need help - technical, philosophical or other - feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/Level/community/issues/new/choose) in [`community`](https://github.com/Level/community) or a more specific repository. We don't (yet) use GitHub Discussions, at least until discussions get the ability to [close them](https://github.com/github/feedback/discussions/3097).

You will generally find someone willing to help. Good questions get better and quicker answers. We do not offer paid support. All time is volunteered.

### Where can I follow progress?

Most if not all activity happens on GitHub. See our [project board](https://github.com/orgs/Level/projects/3) to find out what we're working on. Any timelines there are just a rough indication of priority; we cannot guarantee that feature X or Y will actually be released on the given dates.

Subscribe to individual repositories to follow their progress. All releases are accompanied by a changelog and a GitHub Release, which gives you the option to only [subscribe to new releases](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/setting-up-notifications/configuring-notifications#configuring-your-watch-settings-for-an-individual-repository).

## API

This repository also used to hold a small amount of metadata on past and present contributors. They can be accessed from code by:

```js
console.log(require('level-community'))
```

This metadata is no longer maintained and the npm package will be deprecated at some point. Contributors are instead documented in this README under [People](#people).

## Contributing

[`Level/community`](https://github.com/Level/community) is an **OPEN Open Source Project**. This means that:

> Individuals making significant and valuable contributions are given commit-access to the project to contribute as they see fit. This project is more like an open wiki than a standard guarded open source project.
